# Chosen Web Server

* Date: 15-10-2023

## Context and Problem Statement

The visa application system requires a robust web server in order to handle HTTP requests and serve web pages.

## Considered Options

* Apache HTTP Server
* NGINX
* Node.js
* Lighttpd

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Apache HTTP Server", because Apache HTTP Server is an open-source web server, known for its stability and performance. This makes it a reliable choice. Also, I am experienced with PHP and Apache and PHP are seamlessly integrated.
