# Define Behavioural Viewpoint for System Architecture

* Date: 12-11-2023

## Context and Problem Statement

A dedicated viewpoint is required to capture the dynamic views of the system. The behaviour of the system and how parts of the system interact chronologically is important, especially in this case as parts of the system involve step-by-step processes. Visual Paradigm lists the following types of behavioural diagrams, "Activity Diagram, State Machine Diagram, Sequence Diagram, Communication Diagram, Interactive Overview Diagram, Timing Diagram‚Å∂".

## Considered Options

* Activity Diagram
* State Machine Diagram
* Sequence Diagram
* Communication Diagram
* Interactive Overview Diagram
* Timing Diagram

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Sequence Diagram", because Sequence diagrams allow for a descriptive and chronological representation of interactions between components of the system. They provide a clear representation of the order of events which allows for clear understanding of complex system processes by different stakeholders. Lastly, sequence diagrams are widely used and supported by many modelling tools, making this an easily adoptable approach across the development team.
