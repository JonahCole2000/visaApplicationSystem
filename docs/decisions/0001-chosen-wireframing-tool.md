# Chosen Wireframing Tool

* Date: 20-10-2023

## Context and Problem Statement

Before starting to work on the actual system, a wireframe prototype is needed to display the capabilites of the system and ensure that the proposed system meets the requirements of the stakeholders. There are several different options to choose from for prototype design.

## Considered Options

* Figma
* Protopie
* Justinmind
* Moqups

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Figma", because I have previous experience using Figma, this familiarity reduces the learning curve and also Figma has plugins that allow for wireframes to be exported to HTML, this is helpful for a cohesive design-to-code workflow.
