# Chosen Data Store

* Date: 24-11-2023

## Context and Problem Statement

A decision is required on how the system's data will be stored.

## Considered Options

* Relational Database
* Non-relational Database

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Relational Database", because a relational database, according to MongoDB "using primary and foreign keys allows you to ensure there is no duplicate information. This helps enforce data accuracy because there will never be repeated information⁷" and "RDMS, or SQL databases, have been around for so long that a wide variety of tools and resources have been developed to help get started and interact with relational databases. The English-like syntax of SQL also makes it possible for non-developers to generate reports and queries from the data⁷.". In summary, relational databases are well-established and also provide features like keys to ensure data accuracy, this means that relational databases are a preferred choice for systems that require structured data as a priority.
