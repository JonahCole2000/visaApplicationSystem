# Chosen Behavioural Design Pattern

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2024-01-04

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to select a behavioural design pattern for my system. Refactoring Guru lists the following types: "Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Observer ‚Å∏" and more.

## Considered Options

* Chain of Responsibility
* Command
* Iterator
* Mediator
* Observer

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Observer", because this pattern is flexible, allows for decoupling which promotes maintainability and allows for scalability.
