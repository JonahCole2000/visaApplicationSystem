# Chosen Creational Design Pattern

* Date: 28-12-2023

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to select a creational pattern for my system. The visa application system involves the creation of diverse objects, e.g. visa applications, user accounts.

## Considered Options

* Factory Method Pattern
* Builder Pattern
* Prototype Pattern
* Singleton Pattern

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Factory Method Pattern", because this pattern promotes loose coupling, aligning with the service-oriented architectural style of the system. Also, this pattern encapsulates the object creation logic within each service, promoting modularity in the system.
