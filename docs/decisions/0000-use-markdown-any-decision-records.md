# Use Markdown Any Decision Records

* Date: 17-10-2023
  
## Context and Problem Statement

I want to accurately and efficiently record architectural decisions related to my visa application system.

## Considered Options

* The Markdown Any Decision Records 3.0.0 - [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)
* "Lightweight" ADR, adhering to the template created by Michael Nygard - [ADR](https://adr.github.io/)
* No formal rules or guidelines regarding the organisation or layout

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "The Markdown Any Decision Records 3.0.0", because MADR allows me to record architecture decision records in detail and with structure, without adding unnecessary complexitity, unlike the ADR template. Also MADR is much more fitting for the task than no formal rules as MADR has a predefined template with clear sections, making the architecture decision recording process efficient and consistent.
